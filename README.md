# LifTOvers

## Description 
We are creating a management dashboard to allow LifTOvers admin to manage the "lift" process. The management actions include managing volunteers, lift requests and volunteer SMS service. The application is designed to include role management (admin, user) to allow several levels of management. <br><br>

The main problem that LifTOvers admin faces today is that there is too much administrative work required. This problem creates a slow turnaround time; food donors need to inform LiftOvers 24 hours ahead to request a "lift." Having an easily accessible dashboard of lift requests and volunteers will allow admin to keep the administrative work to a minimum. For example, our application is integrated with the existing SMS-messaging service, and we will automate the lift confirmation process once a volunteer verifies a lift through SMS. 


## Key Features
 * General features: 
    - Twilio backend SMS messaging integration, send/accept/decline requests through SMS messaging
    - Different user authentication levels: admin, volunteer
    - Proper password storage & encryption using best practices
 * Admin features:
    - Add and delete volunteers through the web app.
    - Add and delete lifts through the web app.
    - Add and delete food banks through the web app.
    - Remove donors - donors are updated in real-time through SMS Twilio integration.
    - Change their profile settings & availability. 
    - Export a CSV file format for all data.
    - Promote volunteers to admin status, and change their information as needed.
    - An easy-to-understand graph on the admin dashboard to see key lift statistics. 
 * Volunteer features:
    - Accept lift requests from the website.
    - See their own history of past lifts. 
    - See the lift requests they are currently doing.

    - Accept/cancel lift requests by text (Twilio).



## Instructions
 * Preset Admin account: admin@email.com, password: password123 <br><br>
 * Preset user account: user@email.com, password: password123
 * Our application was built with React and Node.js and has now been deployed on Heroku. You may access the application directly
 “Deployed application: ~~https://cryptic-thicket-16667.herokuapp.com/login~~ Outdated .” (It will take a very long time to the first load up the page because it is deployed on Heroku free tier). <br><br>
 * Admin workflow: <br><br>
    When you first enter our application, you will be greeted with a login page. On this page, you may enter the admin account listed above. <br><br>
    To create a new admin account, you must create a new user and promote it through the preset admin account.<br><br>
    1)<strong> Logged in with given admin credentials (top of this section)</strong><br>
    The admin view will have a dashboard, lifts, volunteers, donors, food banks, edit volunteer, settings, and logout tabs on the left of the screen. Let us go through each option one by one.<br><br>

 ## Development requirements
 Development should be compatible on Windows, MacOS, or Linux. <br>
 We suggest the following process to develop our code further: <br>
 Pull the code to a local repository. Open a terminal and run ```yarn install``` and ```yarn start``` in both the liftovers-develop-client (front-end) and liftovers-develop (back-end) folders. To push to a remote repo, all you have to do is push it to heroku, and heroku will take care of the rest of the deployment process. You must change the server links in the config files for both folders as well - change it to the new deployed locations. 
To develop locally, you can reach the front-end at localhost:3000 and the back-end at localhost:7000 (after running the two yarn commands above).
